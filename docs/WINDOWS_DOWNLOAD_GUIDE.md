# Windows Download

Download the ISO through the official microsoft website <https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10ISO>

In case you ARE on windows, you might not enter the page that is for downloading the ISO image directly.

In that case:

- Press F12 in the browser
- Go to the 3 dots on top right > More Tools > Network Conditions > User Agent > Uncheck (Use browser default) > Choose a Custom that is not Windows
- Refresh the page
- Download the ISO
- Download Rufus at <https://rufus.akeo.ie/>
- Create your bootable OS in your USB drive
- Done!
