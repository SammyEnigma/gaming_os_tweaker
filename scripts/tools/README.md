> If you dont trust the stored files from this folder, you can download them yourself directly from the place where it was downloaded from. I just recommend that if you are going to use scripts, keep/overwrite the .exe you download at this folder, the way it is, otherwise some scripts will not work.

- Device Cleanup CMD - <https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/device_cleanup_cmd>

- Nvidia Profile Inspector - <https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases>

- NanaRun (MinSudo) - <https://github.com/M2Team/NanaRun/releases> - It's the alternative recommendation and from the same team as the now archived NSudo - <https://github.com/M2TeamArchived/NSudo>

- RW (X64 Portable) - <http://rweverything.com/download/>

- Nvidia Control Panel - It's here if someone are unable to install from the driver into their system, not an actual helper tool.
